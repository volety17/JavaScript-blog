## Learn JavaScript Fundamentals

Welcome **Tech Savvys** to the new way of learning JavaScript. I will be covering JavaScript with references from the Internet.

Strange part is, I will be writing the blog as I learn. Thus, It will be a short and quick blog of JavaScript through my boots.

Before we get started, here's my two line introduction: 
I am an IT professional with 5 years of industry experience right now working as UI Developer. I am revisiting  JavaScript to understand the core concepts and I thought best way of learning is to teach someone. 

That's all from this blog. See you soon!!!
