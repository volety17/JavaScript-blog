## Quick facts - JavaScript

Here are some quick facts of JavaScript. Most of you might already know these facts. However, I'm cumulating some artifacts and sharing the consolidated list here.


1. JavaScript was invented by **Brandan Eich** in the year 1995 with the name "**Mocha**". Later on as the proverb says "Sheep goes where the tribe goes", Mocha became "LiveScript" and then it was coined as "**Javascript**".

2. JavaScript was developed in just 10 days.

3. As Brandan Eich understood the popularity and the marketing driven by programming, he gave a standardization to JavaScript with - ECMA Script abbreviated as - **European Computer Manufacturers Association**. Latest version of ECMA Script is 12th Edition which was published in the year 2021.

4. JavaScript is still the only supported scripting language supported by all browsers.

5. JavaScript is an Ocean beneath the Sea - that's right! It's easy to get started with but it only takes true dedication and passion to master it.
